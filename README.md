# myContacts

Small project I did for a code challenge. It's a Contacts viewing app, with an indexed and searchable Contacts list and Contact detail screen.

## Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the source code
2. Update Carthage: `carthage update --platform iOS` (it might take a while)
3. Open the .xcodeproj and run

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
